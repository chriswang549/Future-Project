# Data Analysis Projects

### New Project Upcoming
Motivation:

### Customer Churn on Telecom Data IBM
Motivation: I wanted to work on a dataset that could have valuable insights. Being able to find the factors that contribute to customer churn is something I’m sure a lot of subscription based companies want to find out. I felt that this was also a good data set to learn more about machine learning. I’ve implemented my first neural network using Keras and have visualization to explain what the model is doing. The goal is to have a better understanding of how a neural network works and learn new statistical techniques.

### Analysis of Ramen Reviews
Motivation: The goal of this project is to practice my exploratory data analysis skills on a dataset I was particularly interested in. I put heavy emphasis on making my code more efficient and readable utilizing pipe operators, and commenting on what each code chunk does. I found a lot of unique functions that easily manipulated my data to allow me to better visualize my findings. Given a dataset with ramen reviews, variables that correlate with better ratings were found, and web scraping of written reviews was done to be able to create a word correlation graph.
